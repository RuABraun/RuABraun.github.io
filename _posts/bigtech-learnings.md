come with problem not asking about decision

when asking about something make it clear you are willing to fix it yourself


overly abstract:

"let's make it so you have one class than handles everything!" "the model the data the config!"
"oh shit now i want to do things a bit differently and my omega class cant handle it!"
TOO HIGH LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION
