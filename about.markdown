Like doing different things: Boxing, commercial dance and bouldering. Love discussing movies books TV-shows and music. Used to play violin and french horn, now play bass guitar. Used to play a lot of video games (RTS and FPS, was semi-pro at SC2), still like chatting about them. Speak English German Russian French. Grew up in the US, England and Germany. Now live in New York.<br><br>
