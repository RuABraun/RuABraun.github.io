I'm currently doing speech recognition research at Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland.

Decided I wanted to ASR towards the end of my Bachelor's. Then worked at Speechmatics in Cambridge, afterwards did consulting/contracting through my own company Ark Research Ltd and single-handedly created a speech-to-text app from scratch for Android. 

Probably going to go back to industry soon.

Like doing a lot of different things: Boxing, (modern) dance and bouldering. Love discussing movies books TV shows and music. Used to play violin and french horn, now play bass guitar. Used to play a lot of video games (RTS & FPS), still like chatting about them.
