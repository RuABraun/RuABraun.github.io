Currently at [recapp](https://recapp.ch/), where I'm responsible for improving ASR performance, and dabbling in some academics while still being associated with the Idiap Research Institute.<br><br>

Previously co-founded a health-tech start-up [biped.ai](biped.ai) which won venturekick, spent a year at Idiap Research Institute where among other things I published a paper at [ICASSP on OOV-word recognition](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Comparison-of-Methods-for-OOV-Word-Recognition-on-Braun-Madikeri/c501ae58e3af9877bf03cfa45050decc36515457).<br><br> Before that did consulting/contracting through my own company Ark Research Ltd, single-handedly created a speech-to-text app ("typefree") from scratch for Android and worked at Speechmatics on ASR.<br><br>

Like doing a lot of different things: Boxing, commercial/contemporary dance and bouldering. Love discussing movies books TV-shows and music. Used to play violin and french horn, now play bass guitar. Used to play a lot of video games (RTS and FPS, was semi-pro at SC2), still like chatting about them. Speak English German Russian French, grew up in the LA; Devon, England and Potsdam, Germany.<br><br>
