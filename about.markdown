Co-founded a health-tech start-up: <a href="https://soundmap.io">soundmap.io</a> !<br><br>

Currently at <a href=https://recapp.ch/>recapp</a>, where I'm responsible for improving ASR performance.<br><br>

Previously spent a year at Idiap Research Institute where among other things I published a paper at ICASSP on OOV-word recognition.<br><br> Before that did consulting/contracting through my own company Ark Research Ltd and single-handedly created a speech-to-text app ("typefree") from scratch for Android and worked at Speechmatics on ASR.<br><br>

Like doing a lot of different things: Boxing, commercial/contemporary dance and bouldering. Love discussing movies books TV shows and music. Used to play violin and french horn, now play bass guitar. Used to play a lot of video games (RTS and FPS, was semi-pro at SC2), still like chatting about them. Speak English German Russian French.<br><br>
