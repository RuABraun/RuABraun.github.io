About me personally, I was born in the US but grew up in England and Germany. I like doing various hobbies than I can continuously get better such as dance, bouldering, improv, boxing, writing and more. Used to play a lot of video games (RTS and FPS, was semi-pro at SC2), still like chatting about them. Love reading a good story. Currently in New York.
