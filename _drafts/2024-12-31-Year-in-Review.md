Like last year I'm going talk about some favourite media I've consumed, but inspired by this [post](https://zhengdongwang.com/2024/12/29/2024-letter.html) I'm going try something new and include some freeform thoughts.

# A jumble of thoughts

o1 and [test time compute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaAonE58sLU) have me convinced. I think we're going to see AGI-like agents very soon. The ability to consider a choice before making one will I expect lead to a step change in reliability, which was the major reason why these systems were not good enough to do tasks independently. Jobs which don't require longterm memory like frontline call centers will be automated very soon. Who knows how long it will take for longterm memory to be cracked, but based on current trends not long! But I do think as the capabilities get better we will discover more challenges to tackle, so I don't expect things to improve as straightforwardly as some make it out to be (the "we're all going to lose our jobs" commentators).

I've been surprised by how the EU's moves to focus on regulation have trickled down to the  people. Talking to European friends they have developed a focus on being careful and minimizing excess. This wouldn't be bad by itself but I believe the emphasis to be taken to the point that there isn't much thought put towards future possibilities. I'm not optimistic on Europe. The best clothes shopping though for sure. I'm no expert but think New York may be overrated if you have the option to shop in Europe instead. Style is better, prices are cheaper and things are closer together.

The best museum I visited in 2024 was the Royal Greenwich Observatory in London. Fascinating to learn how mapping the stars and accurate timekeeping was critically important for seafaring navigation and how solutions were found. I like London a lot in general. I was in Vienna too which was fine. To be fair I was sick and didn't get to see that much, but I was expecting a smaller Paris and that it was not. I'd rather just go to Paris.

# Books

Another year of not much fiction. Honourable mention to "Wide Sargasso Sea", great prose. Some great non-fiction finds though:

## [Price of Peace - Money, Democracy and the Life of Keynes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49644992-the-price-of-peace)
**The past fifty years of economic policy have been ignoring that we live in a post-scarcity society.**

> Most of us understand our work as something functional. [..] We want to believe our economic status, even if shaded by luck and circumstance, has at least something to do with our contribution to society. [..] But in a post-scarcity economy, the very meaning of work was a technicality, something people just have to do because it keeps the system running, not because it is truly essential to clothing and feeding the public. Much of what we imagine ourselves to be contributing to society through our work is in fact an accounting trick to enable consumption.

I vaguely knew John Maynard Keynes was a major figure in economics, but this book came as a revelation: The story of one person's life intertwining with major historical events and  along the way pulling the entire field of economics into and beyond the 20th century. 

The last part is on the evolution of his ideas after his death, this is not as excellent as the previous parts, but still makes for interesting reading.

The cool thing is you basically get an education of economics by reading along with Keynes' realizations.

## [The Road Less Traveled](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347852.The_Road_Less_Traveled)

**A how-to to life.**

> What happened to this man was that as a young he suffered painful disappointment after painful disappointment through his parents' lack of caring. Gradually or suddenly he came to the agonizing realization in mid-childhood that he could not trust his parents. Once he realized this [..] his life became more comfortable. [..] He no longer expected things from his parents or got his hopes up when they made promises. [..]
> Such an adjustment, however, is the basis for future problems. To a child his or her parents are everything; they represent the world. The child does not have the perspective to see that other parents are different and frequently better. He assumes that the way his parents do things is the way that things are done. Consequently the realization - the 'reality' - that this child came to was not "I can't trust my parents" but "I can't trust people."

I'm still reading this book. It's taking me a surprisingly long time. Usually that would mean I'm not enjoying it. But in this case it's because I feel almost scared about the prospect of turning the next page and being met with yet another in hindsight obvious fundamental truth which prompts to me reflect on and reevaluate everything.
I think to some most of what's in here will be obvious. I wish that were the case for me.
Rereading some of the earlier parts for this review it's incredible how dense this ~350 page book is. Every sentence is a mighty swing of a hammer mercilessly driving the point home. I feel after finishing it (estimating 4-5 months!) I would benefit from a reread!

## [The Ode Less Traveled](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66856.The_Ode_Less_Travelled)

**If you have any interest in poetry you must read this.**

Amusing coincidence to read this in the same year as the just mentioned.
I loved the numerous poems used as examples for some stylistic choice that a poem writer can make. I loved learning about how English poetry developed because of how words have stressed and unstressed syllables, in contrast to French. I wish I could write 20 lines of pentameter with trochaecs, spondees and caesuras in 45 minutes, alas I can't to a level I'd be happy with, but I loved the opportunity to try, and I plan to try again.

## [The Thin Red Line](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/92417.The_Thin_Red_Line)

**Not just a war novel, how difficult it is to truly know and understand each other.**

> He could not believe that any of them might actually hit somebody. If one did, what a nowhere way to go: killed by accident; slain not as an individual but by sheer statistical probability, by the calculated chance of searching fire, even as he himself might be at any moment. Mathematics! Mathematics! Algebra! Geometry! When 1st and 3d Squads came diving and tumbling back over the tiny crest, Bell was content to throw himself prone, press his cheek to the earth, shut his eyes, and lie there. God, oh, God! Why am I _here_? Why am I _here_? After a moment's thought, he decided he better change it to: why are _we_ here. That way, no agency of retribution could exact payment from him for being selfish.

The best war novels go deep into their characters and this goes deeper. What makes this stand out is the diversity of the cast. This isn't a story where you get the perspective of just one person's experiences and feelings (like e.g. All Quiet on The Western Front), instead you get multiple and the different takes people had on the same situation. Loved it!

# Articles

## [Trump Is Planning for a Landslide Win](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-campain-election-2024-susie-wiles-chris-lacivita/678806/)

**Trump's campaign managers bet on a new strategy for targeting and motivating voters.**

> Political consultants often consider eligible voters on a one-to-five scale: Ones being the people who never miss an election and hand out campaign literature in their spare time, fives being the reclusive types who can’t be canvassed, have never cast a vote, and probably never will. Most campaigns [..] focus their resources on the ones and twos. “There was this other bucket that we identified: low-propensity Trump supporters,” Wiles said. “We sort of took a gamble, but we were really sure that those tier-three people would be participating, that they would be our voters.”
> Several times in the summer and fall of 2023, I heard from DeSantis allies who were bewildered by what Trump’s team was (and wasn’t) doing on the ground. “Our opponents were spending tens of millions of dollars paying for voter contacts for people to knock on doors,” LaCivita said. “And we were spending tens of thousands printing training brochures and pretty hats with golden embroidery on them.”

How did Trump manage to come back from his 2020 election loss and Jan 6? How did Harris lose despite having access to enormous amounts of money (more than Trump)? Written before Biden dropped out, I think this article shows how a significant factor was the Trump campaign strategy that focused on motivating their supporters to turn out.
## [American Vulcan](https://www.tabletmag.com/feature/american-vulcan-palmer-luckey-anduril)

**Palmer Luckey's journey from whizkid to outcast to Tony Stark.**

> “At some point, in business and in life and in romance, you have to commit to a path,” said the 31-year-old Luckey. “A lot of my peers in the tech industry do not share this philosophy. They’re always pursuing everything with optionality. [..]
> “In keeping their options open, they ensure that they’re going to jump from option to option. If you don’t commit to a path, you’re going to fail at it … You have to commit to it to make it work, and I think marriage is the same way. You just have to commit to it. You have to say, ’This is the path I’m on. For better or for worse, I’m going to double down on it.’”
> “The one thing money can’t buy,” said Luckey, “is people who liked you before you had money. I’m very lucky that I met my wife back when I had literally nothing. When we met, I had less than $300 in my bank account. I probably should have gotten married, should have married her when I was 16. Looking back, I think that’s probably my radical belief.”

I had never looked into Luckey's story before and I'm glad I waited for this deep dive so all the details were new and exciting to me. It's refreshing to read about someone who's just excited to get things done but also has a relatively humble background and remembers that but doesn't let it hold him back. Exciting to see him succeed despite his detractors, who seem to be acting out of deference to what a social media hive says rather than reality.

### [JD Vance Profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/11/04/j-d-vance-profile)

**I think this guy might stick around.**

Clearly opportunistic and smart. I think he is someone who wants to do good and is not solely in it for personal enrichment, even if a major motivator may be amassing power. Hard to judge.
# Movies

## Anora

**The best movies mix genres and 5 years after Parasite we have another gem.

To me this movie is a class commentary. It's about how for most people they're just trying to get by and if possible ahead. That's Anora, Toros (the priest), Igor and most of the other characters. All their actions are to some level expected being motivated by the need to not fall behind and seize opportunity where it exists. Separately though, there are a class of people who don't have to worry about getting by. See Ivan. His actions are the ones we we're curious to know, because all the other's are based on what he does. And as long as that uncertainty exists we get to see the comedy and the tragedy of the other class trying to get by. And what a comedy! The execution of the plot is marvelous.
The ending really makes the movie though. I've never seen such a switch in tone pulled of so seamlessly.
