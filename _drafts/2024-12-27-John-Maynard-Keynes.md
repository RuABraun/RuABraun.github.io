## The Price of Peace - John Maynard Keynes


This book blew my mind.

Some of the ideas I took away from it:

- Money requires a state to exist and the state must make decisions how to manage it, and not managing it is also a decision with negative consequences.
- We live in an age of abundance, we produce enough that everyone's basic needs are or could be met. This happened in the early 20th century.
- Because of the abundance, the advertising industry started and has continued to grow to try and convince people of where to invest their abundance.
- Not having a state economic policy and letting the market do what it wants ("laissez-faire"), has two serious issues:
	- 1. Irrationality of humans mean market failures (e.g. bubbles collapsing) can happen with serious negative consequences to everyone's standard of living.
	- 2. Growing inequality as winners use their advantage to grow their lead, causing resentment towards them which destabilizes society.
- There is no one economic policy that is correct. One has to choose an ideal for society and base economic policy on that.
- Slumps in the economy can happen which must be dealt by stimulating demand (i.e. the state making big investments).
- But the state should stay away from trying to do what companies already do, instead the state should focus on what companies *can't* do.
- A government which controls it's own money supply (no gold standard) can relatively easily access additional funds and thereby stimulate demand when necessary (excessive spending when society does not save enough can lead to inflation though)
- In our age of abundance (post-scarcity), most work is not actually necessary and is more about keeping the system running rather than an actually a meaningful contribution to society.
